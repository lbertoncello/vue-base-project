# Vue Base Project

This is a boilerplate to start new Vue projects. It also comes with [Vite], [ESLint] and [Prettier] configured and installed. 

# Getting Started

This project uses [Husky] and [git-commit-msg-linter] to run some CI pipelines to ensure that only tested and standardized commits will be accepted. To install the CI pipelines, just run the following commands:

  ```
    yarn install
    yarn prepare
  ```
